                 The hard event is where new physics might be found,
                 and the end points of the shower are the detectable remnants of this.
                 Three types of noise are depicted; MPI, pileup, and ISR.

    You are the bread and the knife,\\
    the crystal goblet and the wine.\\
    You are the dew on the morning grass\\
    and the burning wheel of the sun.\\
    You are the white apron of the baker,\\
    and the marsh birds suddenly in flight.\\
